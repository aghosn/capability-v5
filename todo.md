## Current State (2026-05-20)

### What works

- **Dom0**: boots to login on 4 CPUs. Ubuntu Noble 6.8.0-107-generic. Stable.
- **Dom1 Linux (1 CPU)**: full systemd boot under Themis (emergency.target on local
  QEMU due to missing fstab — known, not a regression).
- **Dom1 Linux (2 CPUs)**: full systemd boot to login prompt. Verified 2026-04-14.
- **Eunomia as dom1**: ✅ boots under full Themis stack (capavisor + dom0 + CHV).
  All 33/33 tests pass (incl. timer via TSC-deadline, CPUID). 7 workloads.
  `cargo build-bins` now rebuilds Eunomia workloads before packaging.
- **Platform modularization**: complete. Opaque ArchDomainState/ArchPlatformState,
  aarch64 cross-check 0 errors. Generic monitor loop with SemanticExit dispatch.
- **AArch64 M1–M5c**: boot → memory → EL2 → GICv3 → guest → PSCI → Linux initramfs.
  M6 partial (full Ubuntu boot blocked by QEMU TCG overhead, needs real ARM HW).
- **Capability engine**: MAP_SELF implemented (refcounted projections, 33 tests).
  83 Lean theorems, 0 sorry. lean-exec 21/21 differential tests passing.
  GPA-aware view_diff with lazy dirty-flag caching.
- **TPM attested boot**: Ed25519 + SHA-256 + TPM PCR extend. CRB/TIS auto-select.
- **CoCo guest kernel**: CC_VENDOR_THEMIS patch in `../linux`.  Minimal config
  (245 modules), virtio/ext4/9p built-in.
- **MAP_SELF hypercall**: wired across themis-abi (0x1f), capavisor handler, thhv.
- **COMM-as-SEND + DomainComm**: ✅ COMM pages provisioned via CARVE+SEND (commit
  `1d9867d8d`). CHV slot splitting for confidential memory (commit `235ed4c81`).
  `domcomm_discover` and `attest_dequeue` Eunomia tests pass.
- **Compound allocation batching** (uncommitted): thhv uses `alloc_pages(order)` for
  META and COMM pages. Contiguous runs merged into single CARVE+SEND. Reduces
  attestation cap count from ~128 to ~24.
- **CPUID/MSR interposition policy**: ✅ fully policy-driven. All CPUID leaves
  (including hypervisor range) go through PolicyDriven path. No ArchHandled special
  case. CHV pushes Native/Emulate overrides for dom1. CoCo leaf (0x40000100)
  returns dynamic VTOM bit = MAXPHYADDR-1.
  `cargo diff-test` (from capa-cli/) runs automated Rust-vs-Lean differential
  testing on all 16 tutorials.
- **Dom1 CoCo detection**: ✅ kernel detects CC_VENDOR_THEMIS, reads VTOM bit 38.
- **MMIO VTOM stripping**: ✅ IO-APIC reads correctly (`version 17, GSI 0-23`)
  after stripping VTOM bit in CHV's handle_mmio_exit and emulator translate_gva.
- **VTOM EBDA double-map**: ✅ CHV double-maps ACPI/EBDA region at VTOM-offset GPA
  so CoCo kernel can access firmware tables with VTOM bit set.
- **GPA-native view computation**: ✅ ViewRegion carries both GPA (`access.start`)
  and HPA (`physical_start`). `ensure_view_fresh()` translates HPA→GPA via
  address_map entries (identity fallback when uncovered). `view_diff` produces
  {GPA, HPA} ChangeRights directly. Same-HPA-at-two-GPAs (VTOM double-map)
  naturally produces two view regions. Tutorial 17 validates. Removed
  `snapshot_view`, `translate_view_to_gpa`, `fixup_domain_addresses` from
  carve/send/accept (kept in revoke for tree-walk updates).
- **Lazy view caching**: ✅ `Domain.view_dirty` flag — mutations mark dirty,
  `ensure_view_fresh()` recomputes only when read. Eliminates redundant
  double-recomputation. No loom gate — full correctness under loom.
- **Cross-domain revoke cleanup**: ✅ `remove_memory_capability_by_ref()` eagerly
  removes capability from child domain's table using `Weak::ptr_eq` (can't use
  prune since Arc is still alive on revoke_child's stack).

### What doesn't work / known issues

- **Dom1 virtio-blk rootfs failure**: kernel boots fully (ACPI, PCI, 2 CPUs) but
  panics at VFS mount — `/dev/vda1` shows as `unknown-block(0,0)` error -6.
  Virtio-blk not registering; likely transport negotiation or IOMMU/DMA issue.
  **Must fix before CoCo e2e.**
- **Unguarded interrupt injection**: 2 fallback paths without RFLAGS.IF check.
- **Posted interrupts**: hardware PI disabled (software PIR drain instead).
- **Dom1 on real hardware**: not yet tested.
- **KVM nested dom1**: CHV FailEntry under nested QEMU — only Themis backend works.
- **CoCo share-back**: MAP_SELF wired, channels wired (GET/SEND/ACCEPT).
  Not yet tested end-to-end. Need Eunomia workload first.

### Recent commits

### ~~BUG-16: vtom_double_map~~ ✅ Fixed

Fixed in commit `9c13207af`. Root causes: (1) attestation reported HPA in both
GPA and HPA fields — fixed by using `mapped_gpas` via structured attestation API;
(2) unnecessary `map_4k` call on identity-mapped addresses — removed;
(3) `send_chan` vs `send` confusion in bounce_buffer_send — corrected.

## Active Work Streams

### 1. Eunomia — minimal micro-kernel guest ✅ Phase A complete

Design docs: [`docs/architecture/eunomia.md`](docs/architecture/eunomia.md),
[`docs/architecture/eunomia-roadmap.md`](docs/architecture/eunomia-roadmap.md)

Eunomia is the test vehicle for core-gapping and CoCo before tackling Linux dom1
complexity.  ~1200 LOC, boots in <50ms, 6 workloads / 24 tests.

**Completed (E1–E7, Phase A)**:
- Boot (PVH 32→64, GDT/TSS, IDT, LAPIC timer, bump allocator, scheduler)
- HypervisorInterface trait (ThemisBackend VMCALL, StubBackend)
- Workload model (independent crates, `app_main` entry point)
- CHV PVH boot + ACPI shutdown exit path
- `cargo run-chv` alias, `run-eunomia.sh` for dom0
- pvh-info workload (validates hvm_start_info, memmap, RSDP)
- ✅ Timer: TSC-deadline mode, vector 0xEC (matches CHV's irqfd injection)
- ✅ All 24/24 tests pass under QEMU, CHV, and full Themis stack
- ✅ `cargo build-bins` rebuilds Eunomia workloads before packaging
- ✅ Clean serial output (CR+LF)

**Next**:
- [ ] Phase B: CoCo integration (shared.rs, MAP_SELF, CHANNEL_SEND workload)
- [ ] Phase C: Core-gapping workload (Forward policy, VMX preemption timer)

### 2. Core-gapping (design complete, implementation pending)

Design doc: [`docs/architecture/core-gapping.md`](docs/architecture/core-gapping.md)

Run child domain on dedicated core, events forwarded to dom0 on separate core
via shared pages + IPI.  Eliminates cache side channels and single-stepping.

**Design decisions (settled)**:
- `Forward { target_core, synchronous }` policy variant
- VMX preemption timer for local timer delivery (2 exits/tick, zero IPIs)
- Shared notification area = existing VpCommPage / meta page
- Policy-driven: core-gapping emerges from per-event Forward policies

**Implementation plan**:
- [ ] `InterruptPolicy::Forward` variant in capa-engine + tests
- [ ] Capavisor Forward handler (write event → IPI → poll response → VMRESUME)
- [ ] thhv.ko doorbell ISR on core 0
- [ ] VMX preemption timer for TSC-deadline → local timer delivery
- [ ] Core isolation in dom0 (cpu offline, watchdog disable, pin switch thread)
- [ ] Eunomia core-gap workload for end-to-end validation

### 3. Confidential VMs — CoCo (active)

Design doc: [`docs/architecture/confidential-vm.md`](docs/architecture/confidential-vm.md)

Dom1 memory private by default.  VTOM address-space split for explicit sharing.
No hardware encryption needed — EPT isolation provides equivalent protection.

**What already works**:
- CARVE+SEND removes pages from sender (dom0) EPT → dom1 memory is exclusive ✅
- MAP_SELF engine operation implemented (refcounted projections, 33 tests) ✅
- MAP_SELF hypercall wired: themis-abi (0x1f), capavisor handler, thhv ✅
- CC_VENDOR_THEMIS kernel patch exists in `../linux` (CPUID detection, cc_mkenc/cc_mkdec, VTOM) ✅
- CoCo guest kernel config (245 modules, virtio/ext4/9p built-in) ✅
- CPUID/MSR interposition policy framework in capa-engine ✅
  - Generic ProcFeature trait, ProcFeatureConfig<T>, Cpuid/Msr types
  - DomainPolicy extended with CpuidPolicy + MsrPolicy
  - Attestation includes CPUID/MSR policies
  - capa-cli: set-policy parsing for all interposition variants
  - lean-exec: DefaultAction/ProcFeatureConfig types, setPolicy/getPolicy support
  - Design doc: `docs/architecture/cpuid-policy.md`

**What needs implementation (interposition wiring)**: ✅ DONE
- [x] themis-abi: policy_kind constants for CPUID/MSR PolicyIdentifier variants
- [x] Capavisor: all CPUID leaves through PolicyDriven path
- [x] CHV: push Native/Emulate CPUID policy during domain setup
- [x] VTOM bit stripping in handle_mmio_exit + emulator translate_gva

**What needs implementation (ACPI firmware double-map)**:
- [x] CHV: double-map EBDA (0xA0000–0xFFFFF) at VTOM-offset GPA during
      initialization (committed CHV `bc2ccfe`)
- [x] Engine: GPA-aware view_diff handles same-HPA-at-two-GPAs correctly
      (committed `2b34aad`, `84bfaed`, `53d7b1e`)
- [ ] **NEXT**: Boot dom0 + CoCo dom1, verify kernel gets past ACPI table parsing

**What needs implementation (CoCo end-to-end)**:
- [x] CHV: `--platform confidential=on` flag. Guest RAM → CARVE, MMIO → ALIAS.
- [x] Capavisor: wire CHANNEL GET/SEND/ACCEPT hypercalls (0x1e, 0x20, 0x21)
- [x] thhv: auto-provision parent-back-channel at domain creation
- [x] CHV: gate VTOM/EBDA/CoCo-CPUID on confidential mode (vtom_bit=0 when off)
- [ ] Eunomia CoCo workload: domcomm+attest+vtom_double_map+bounce_send all pass ✅
      Structured attestation API in engine (single source of truth).
- [ ] thhv: receive pending capability from child (wait for event, ACCEPT_CHAN)
- [ ] CHV: receive shared regions back from dom1 (accept alias via channel)
- [ ] Dom1 kernel: early init share-back — create aliases of swiotlb pool,
      MAP_SELF at VTOM GPA, CHANNEL_SEND the other to dom0
- [ ] End-to-end: Linux dom1 boots with CC_VENDOR_THEMIS, swiotlb active,
      virtio works through shared bounce buffers

**Open questions**:
- Channel revocation semantics (does revoking endpoint cascade to sent caps?)
  → Resolved: yes, CDT cascades naturally (see design doc §9.8)
- **Intercept message register leak fix** (active):
  `forward_child_exit` currently embeds register values (RAX, RIP,
  RFLAGS, CPUID leaf/subleaf, MSR number/value) directly in the
  `InterceptMessage`, bypassing `ExitPolicy.read_set`. Fix plan:
  1. **Capavisor**: slim `InterceptMessage` to exit metadata only
     (exit_reason, exit_qualification, guest_physical_address,
     instruction_length, instruction_bytes, port/size/is_write).
     Register values stay in COMM page register area, gated by read_set.
  2. **thhv**: after reading slim intercept, populate register fields
     by reading from COMM page register area based on exit_reason
     (IO → RAX; MSR → RCX/RDX/RAX; CPUID → RAX/RCX). Assembles
     full `themic_intercept_message` for CHV.
  3. **CHV**: unchanged — same struct, same dispatch code.
  Policy enforcement is automatic: read_set zeros disallowed registers
  in COMM page → thhv reads zeros → CHV sees zeros.
  Engine-side `ExitPolicy` (ExitAction with trap/read_set/write_set,
  register_access_check, set_policy hypercall) already complete.
  Related: `themis/capavisor/src/hypercall.rs` forward_child_exit,
  `thhv/src/thhv_vp.c` thhv_read_intercept_msg,
  `capa-engine/src/domain.rs` ExitPolicy/ExitAction.
- **Refine per-exit-reason policies for confidential mode**: The default
  ExitPolicy uses `RegBitmap::ALL` (read & write) for child domains.
  When booting dom1 Linux in confidential mode, the child (or its
  creation policy) should restrict read_set/write_set per exit reason
  so the parent can only see/modify the registers actually needed
  (e.g., IO exits → RAX only; CPUID → RAX/RCX; MSR → RCX/RAX/RDX).
  Infrastructure is fully wired (`set_policy` hypercall, `ExitReasonRegReadSet`,
  `ExitReasonRegWriteSet`); only needs concrete policy definitions.
- **Future optimization**: mmap COMM page to CHV userspace so CHV reads
  registers directly without ioctl round-trips. Would eliminate thhv
  register-assembly step entirely.

### 4. Contiguous physical memory for VMs (research needed)

**Problem**: VMs need physically contiguous memory regions for efficient EPT
mapping (2M/1G pages) and DMA.  Currently CHV allocates guest memory via
mmap which gives scattered 4K pages.  This matters for:
- EPT performance (fewer page table entries with large pages)
- IOMMU mapping (IOVA=GPA requires contiguous backing, axiom A4)
- Core-gapping shared notification area (meta pages)

**Questions to investigate**:
- [ ] Can CHV use hugetlbfs (2M/1G hugepages) for guest memory?
- [ ] Does the Themis CARVE+SEND flow preserve contiguity?
- [ ] Do we need a capavisor-side contiguous allocator for meta/notification pages?
- [ ] Impact on memory fragmentation under multiple domains

### 5. Inter-domain shared memory / ivshmem equivalent (research needed)

**Problem**: Domains need private shared memory for communication (not through
dom0).  Use cases:
- Core-gapped child ↔ dom0 event queue (currently meta page, but needs scaling)
- Domain-to-domain direct communication (e.g., crypto enclave ↔ app domain)
- High-bandwidth data plane without dom0 intermediary

**Questions to investigate**:
- [ ] Does CHV support ivshmem or similar shared memory device?
- [ ] Can ALIAS capabilities serve as the shared memory primitive?
  (A creates ALIAS, sends to B via CHANNEL → both map same HPAs)
- [ ] How does this interact with VTOM / CoCo? (shared window must be at
  GPA|VTOM in both domains)
- [ ] Performance: polling vs doorbell interrupt for notification
- [ ] Could Eunomia-to-Eunomia communication be the first test case?

### 6. AArch64 backend (blocked on hardware)

Design doc: [`docs/architecture/arm-porting.md`](docs/architecture/arm-porting.md)

M1–M5c complete.  M6 (full Ubuntu boot) blocked by QEMU TCG Stage-2 overhead.
Needs real ARM hardware with KVM to validate.

### 7. Posted interrupts / hardware PI (deferred)

Requires `intel_iommu=on` and IOMMU intremap support.  Currently using software
PIR drain.  Not blocking any active work stream.

### ~~TODO: Platform modularization~~ ✅ Complete
### ~~TODO: Implement VITAL cascade in Lean~~ ✅ Complete
### ~~TODO: Full TPM attestation~~ ✅ Complete
